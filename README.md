# openbabel gem

GEM for [OpenBabel](http://openbabel.sf.net), a chemical library by Noel O'Boyle and others.

openbabel gem has been tested with ruby 1.9. It only compiles on POSIX systems and requires the following to be installed already:

  * openbabel library
  * cmake
  * curl
  * tar, sed, make (those should be present anyway)

## Install
gem install openbabel

It downloads the sources, compiles the ruby bindings and installs them. Check out [http://cs.maunz.de](http://cs.maunz.de) for more information.
